## Stat 380: Coin Flip Regression

I divided the data into train and test datasets by a 80:20 ratio and I did not do any feature engineering at all since the features are coin flips which should be random. 
I used XGBoost to predict the dataset and used logistic regression as my objective hyperparamter. 

Ranked above the full points benchmark. :)
